# Code Style and Standards

Please follow the coding style and standards used in the project.

  - Indentation: Use 2 spaces for indentation on every loop black and function for better readability.
    
  - Code Naming Conventions: Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Use snake case naming eg -> myFunction(), not my_function().
    
  - Branch Naming Convention: should be lowercase and don't use underscore. eg -> home-page not Home Page or home_page.
    
  - Comments: Add comments to explain complex code or any non-intuitive parts
    
  - Readability: Write clear, easy-to-understand code.
    
  - Testing: Test thoroughly before creating a PR (Pull Request).
    
  - Header and Source Files (Important): When creating classes or functions, use header files (.h or .hpp) for declarations and source files (.cpp) for implementations.
    The classes directory is self-explanatory it will contain only header (.h) files, basically classes with no methods.
    The components directory will store classes with methods.
    Examples of classes and components are given as date_schema and random_number_generator respectively.
